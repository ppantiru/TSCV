    <h1>Alright, so what exactly do I consider to be good at?</h1>
    <p>So let's start with a mandatory disclaimer. I'm not gonna list here every thing I've done since I was a baby (that's in the CV sort of),
      but rathen what my current intersts are when it comes to technologies and what skills I consider useful in a company like Thin Slices.</p>
      So let's start with the basics:

    <h2>Comunication</h2>
    <p>An important soft skill that takes more than meets the eye.</p>
    <p>Besides the languages, of which I am <em>fluent in romanian and english</em> with a bit of french understanding sprinckled in,
     comunication includes oher things, most importantly <em>active listening and understanding</em> and <em>tailored response for the interlocutor</em>.</p>
    <p>The ability to formulate a coherent and clear message does not mean the same thing for everyone, 
      so if the msesage is intended for a specific person or group, creating a very structured and rational response might not cut it (although it is my prefered way of comunication).</p>
    <p>This understanding kept me in friendly relations with everyone I worked with.</p>

    <h2>Curiosity</h2>
    <p>Curiosity killed the cat... because the cat was stupid and didn't take the ncessary precautions. (I don't hate cats... put the rotten tomato down)</p>
    <p>Curiosity is the fuel for understanding and I like understanding how the world works,
       including new technologies and ways of using it (even if it was not necesarily intended for a certain usecase).</p>
    <p>In short I have lots of “How does X work?” in my browser history. From the web, browsers, compilers, computers, electricity down to quantum mechanics and far into space.</p>

    <h2>Problem solver</h2>
    <p>I've basically written a paper on this and I go into a lot more detail in the <a href='/problem-solving'>next tab</a>.</p>
    <p>The very short version is: Any problem can be solved if you understand it and actively look for the right perspective to approach it.</p>
    <p>After going through differnt types of work withing the company I work for at the moment, development,
       infra, technical support and working with people of differnt skill levels
       I have on many ocasions ended up with a task on my lap with the message "Stuff not working, we don't know why... pls fix!",
       Or the ocasional "We want to... nay, we NEED to implement X" where the response had to always be "I have no clue how to do this, but I'll figure something out."
    </p>

    <h2>Techonologies</h2>
    <p>The standard model I've seen for this kind of section is to lay donw a long list of programming languages and other thechnologies, the more the better.</p>
    <p>I don't believe that's an actual indication of what a person can actually do, but rather of their preferences, and even preferences change over time.</p>
    <p>The main point of this section is that the programming languages and the other techonologies used are a tool to reach an objective,
       not a lifestyle, and they can be learned rather fast with enough curiosity/motivation/determination</p>
    <p>However, it is still important to have worked with at least some techonolgies to be able to learn new ones, 
      therefor I will still enumerate some of the stuff I either used recently or have in my preference list:
      <ul>
        <li>javascirpt</li>
        <li>nodejs</li>
        <li>react</li>
        <li>python</li>
        <li>bash</li>
        <li>docker</li>
        <li>graphql</li>
        <li>mongodb & mysql</li>
        <li>unreal engine 5</li>
        <li>apache velocity</li>
        <li>groovy</li>
      </ul>
      Prefered OS: Linux, but I can work with whatever.
      </p>

      <p>I could continue, but there's already a scrollbar here meaning there's too much text for the average atention span of a human,
       but I will close with what reality consinders very important.</p>

      <h2>Adaptability</h2>
      <p>Having had enough "oportunities" to work on stuff without enough permissions, limited access, or dificult people, I gathered experience in making due.</p>
      <p>I will change the things that need changing and adapt to those that don't.</p>
